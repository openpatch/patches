# Design System

We are closely following the Refactoring UI Guide (v1.0.2). Everything in our
Design System is present in our theme file. You should rely on it and prevent
to use custom CSS. If you want to use CSS styles which are currently not
covered by the ones in the theme file, please do a pull request and we will
examine if they fit the overall style or how your design can be implemented
more coherent.
