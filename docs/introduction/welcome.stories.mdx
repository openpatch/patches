OPUI is the Design System for OpenPatch.

## Changelog

OPUI follows semantic versioning. In short, this means we use patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for breaking changes. You can read [our changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/openpatch/opui/releases).
