# Patches

Patches is the Design System for OpenPatch.

## Changelog

Patches follows semantic versioning. In short, this means we use patch
versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions
for breaking changes. You can read [our changelog on
GitHub](https://github.com/openpatch/patches/releases).
