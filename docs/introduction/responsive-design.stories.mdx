# Responsive Design

Unlike other design systems Patches does not use responsive props. If you
would like to design a responsive component you should use the `useMedia`
hook.

```tsx
const columns = useMedia({
  breakpoints: {
    sm: 1,
    lg: 5,
  },
  defaultValue: 3,
});

return (
  <AutoGrid columns={columns}>
    <Card>Box 1</Card>
    <Card>Box 2</Card>
    <Card>Box 3</Card>
    <Card>Box 4</Card>
    <Card>Box 5</Card>
    <Card>Box 6</Card>
    <Card>Box 7</Card>
  </AutoGrid>
);
```

This makes is also possible to easily use media queries for other purposes,
like selecting different components based on the width of the viewport.

```tsx
const Icon = useMedia({
  breakpoints: {
    sm: IconLowDetail,
    lg: IconHighDetail,
  },
  defaultValue: IconNormalDetail,
});

return <Icon />;
```
