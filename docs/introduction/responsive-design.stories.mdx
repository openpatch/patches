# Responsive Design

Like many design systems you can use two ways for responsive designs.

## Hook

One way is to use the `useBreakpoint` or `useMedia` hook.

```tsx
const columns = useMedia<number>(
  [`(min-width 200px)`, `(min-width 400px)`],
  [1, 5],
  3
);
const moreColumns = useBreakpoint([3, 1, 5]);

return (
  <AutoGrid columns={columns}>
    <Card>Box 1</Card>
    <Card>Box 2</Card>
    <Card>Box 3</Card>
    <Card>Box 4</Card>
    <Card>Box 5</Card>
    <Card>Box 6</Card>
    <Card>Box 7</Card>
  </AutoGrid>
);
```

This makes is also possible to easily use media queries for other purposes,
like selecting different components based on the width of the viewport.

```tsx
const Icon = useBreakpoint([IconLowDetail, IconNormalDetail, IconHighDetail]);

return <Icon />;
```

The standard theme provides two breakpoints: 768px and 1024px.
The useBreakpoint hook gets a list of three elements. The first element is
returned, when the width of the viewport is below 768px, the second when it
is between 768px and 1024px and the third when it is above 1024px.

## Props

Another way is to use reponsive props.

```tsx
<Box width={["100px", "200px", "100%"]} />
```

Responsive props work exactly like the `useBreakpoint` hook.
