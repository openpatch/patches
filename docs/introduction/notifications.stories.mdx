# Notifications

Notifications are an integral part of any application. Patches uses
[react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) under the hood. We
reexport some parts of react-toastify and apply our own styling.

You need to wrap your application in a PatchesProvider, which you already should
have. Then you can use the `notify` object and dispatch notifications like so:

```
import { notify } from "@openpatch/patches"

notify.info("Info")
notify.warn("Warn")
notify.error("Error")
notify.success("Success")
```

If you want to overwrite the default behaviour of the Notifications, you can
pass an option object to the different functions. Take a look at the
[react-toastify Repository](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/api/toast)
for more information about that.
