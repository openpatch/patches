<Meta title="Hooks/useTheme" />

# Usage

This hook needs to have a `<ThemeProvider />` as its parent.

```ts
import { useTheme } from "@openpatch/patches/hooks";

const [theme, setTheme] = useTheme();

// a partial theme, which will be merged with the base theme
setTheme({
    colors: {
        background: '#FF0';
    }
})
```
